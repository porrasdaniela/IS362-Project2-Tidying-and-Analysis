# IS362-Project2-Tidying-and-Analysis
Jupyter Notebooks for IS 362 Project 2. This project focuses on tidying, transforming, and analyzing three different datasets using Python and pandas. The project includes exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and actionable insights based on each dataset.

Overview:
This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks where I tidy and analyze different datasets as part of Project 2 for my course.

Each notebook follows these steps:

Importing data from a CSV file.
Tidying and transforming the data using pandas.
Performing the analysis requested by my classmates.
Visualizing and interpreting the results.

Datasets Included:
Dataset 1: Construction Data (Regional and Monthly construction statistics).
Dataset 2: Hockey Data (Connor McDavid's last 5 games performance).
Dataset 3: Aaron Judge MLB Data (Season vs Career batting stats).

Requirements:
To run these notebooks, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib
pandas for data tidying, transformations, and summaries.
matplotlib for creating visualizations.

How to Use:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
Open each .ipynb file (one notebook per dataset).
Run each notebook cell to view the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

Notes:
All datasets were manually created or sourced from public statistics pages and discussion board posts shared by classmates.
The project focuses on tidying real-world "wide" datasets into "tidy" formats, performing descriptive analysis, and visualizing results.
